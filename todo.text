so i just started createing all the controllers and used the file structure that I know
which is different from the structure Lun Dev was taking.
I went a head and made all the CRUD controllers and routes.
Not sure if he will do authUser
so i think I need to start making the frontend functiionaliy like calling the api and saving records
